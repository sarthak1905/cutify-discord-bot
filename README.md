# Cutify- A Discord Botüê∂
 Cutify is a discord bot made on python using the discord.py module. It is a simple bot that sends random dog pics or cat gifs as per user request. It uses public 
 APIs to get the files with the help of the requests library and then relays them to the bot.
 
## What can it do‚ùì
 Cutify has been made exclusively for one purpose- to supply you with cute dog/cat pics as per your request. Cutify hopes that your day
 becomes at least a little better with the wholesome sight!

## Commands Available‚öñ
 Cutify has one command of geniune interest for the user-
 ```
 %cutify dog
 ```
 which sends an image of a dog and,
 ```
 %cutify cat
 ```
 which sends a GIF of a cat. You can also check the ping by typing,
 ```
 %ping
 ```
## How does it work‚ùì
 Cutify uses public APIs available for obtaing the images of dogs/GIFs of cats. This information is processed with the help of the requests module
 in python. 
 
## How can I use it‚ùì

 can add it to any server and the bot will run as long as the python script runs.
